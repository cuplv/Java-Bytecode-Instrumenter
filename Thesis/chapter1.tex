The cost model provides estimates pertaining to the execution time for expensive methods in Java bytecode. Java applications are profiled to generate: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Counts of method invocations and 
\item Total execution time of the application for a large number of runs. 
\end{enumerate}
This profiling is performed with the help of bytecode instrumentation. The data generated from these runs is fed to a Linear Regression toolbox to efficiently predict the ``time per method" metric for that specific application.
