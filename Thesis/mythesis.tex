\abstract{  \OnePageChapter	% because it is very short

	We consider the problem of developing an efficient cost model for Java Bytecode, where cost is determined in terms of execution time. The key insight is that the execution time of Java applications can be predicted by modeling these applications based on the method invocation counts and their linear fitting to get an accurate estimate. Cost estimates for an application can be useful in determining parameters such as worst case execution time which can form a basis for static analyses and can be useful in distributed applications.
